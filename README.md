What is Soushakaze?

Soushakaze is a conceptual E-Commerce Airsoft Store where you equip the BB-Guns you plan to buy with a visual Attachment Selector.

Is this a website or a game?

Raising this question was my goal in creating the website. It should blur the line between a game and a website while still feeling like it's much more useful than a simple 2D Solution. This is why I went all out with aggressive animations and styling while still feeling cohesive.
